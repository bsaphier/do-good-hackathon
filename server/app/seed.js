        scam: "A woman came up to me and told me for $15 I would be able to get my hair cut and styled at a nearby 'Upscale' salon. Well, the joke was on me because I got what I paid for and I am NOT happy! I can do a better job cutting my own hair. Buyer beware.",

        scam: "Some guy came up to me and asked for directions to East Village. Then he started to compliment me on my voice and look. He said he was a Nickelodeon executive and he could get me on upcoming season of some show Selena Gomez is on if I give him $3,000 for the audition. A couple of meetings later and calls to a now disconnected number proves that he is a scam artist. Now, I am out of $3,000! :(",

        title: "Fake Handbags",
        scam: "I'm from North Dakota and this is my first time visiting New York. I was so excited to see the Empire State building and Statue of Liberty (typical tourist things, don't judge me). So I after my sister and I got off the train at Canal street we saw some designer handbags. We were so happy to get expensive bags at such a discount! About a month later after parading around town with our New York fashionista bags, they started to fall apart at the seams...Literally! We were conned out of a couple of hundred dollars ;-( RIP to my knock-off Louis Vuitton ",

        scam: "My girlfriend and I were enjoying the totally hip vibe of Williamsburg and a man on the street told us about this cool underground jazz showcase a couple of blocks away. The great thing about it was that he happen to have tickets to get in because it was so exclusive so we paid him $40 and he gave us directions to the den. We GPS the address just to make sure and we arrived at deli store (I think the locals call it a bodega). The man at the counter laughed at us when we showed him the tickets. ",
