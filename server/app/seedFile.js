        scam: "A woman came up to me and told me for $15 I would be able to get my hair cut and styled at a nearby 'Upscale' salon. Well, the joke was on me because I got what I paid for and I am NOT happy! I can do a better job cutting my own hair. Buyer beware.",

        title: "Nickelodeon Dude",
        scam: "Some guy came up to me and asked for directions to East Village. Then he started to compliment me on my voice and look. He said he was a Nickelodeon executive and he could get me on upcoming season of some show Selena Gomez is on if I give him $3,000 for the audition. A couple of meetings later and calls to a now disconnected number proves that he is a scam artist. Now, I am out of $3,000! :(",

        title: "Fake Handbags",
        scam: "I'm from North Dakota and this is my first time visiting New York. I was so excited to see the Empire State building and Statue of Liberty (typical tourist things, don't judge me). So I after my sister and I got off the train at Canal street we saw some designer handbags. We were so happy to get expensive bags at such a discount! About a month later after parading around town with our New York fashionista bags, they started to fall apart at the seams...Literally! We were conned out of a couple of hundred dollars ;-( RIP to my knock-off Louis Vuitton ",

        title: "Where's the Jazz?",
        scam: "My girlfriend and I were enjoying the totally hip vibe of Williamsburg and a man on the street told us about this cool underground jazz showcase a couple of blocks away. The great thing about it was that he happen to have tickets to get in because it was so exclusive so we paid him $40 and he gave us directions to the den. We GPS the address just to make sure and we arrived at deli store (I think the locals call it a bodega). The man at the counter laughed at us when we showed him the tickets. Totally killed my mellow vibe, man.",

        scam: "I am relatively new to NYC and I was biking to this cool Vegan restaurant in Tribeca. I had no where to lock my bike so I asked what I thought was a nice guy where can I put my bike while I am in the restaurant. He told me to just lean it against the wall on the sidewalk outside the entrance and the host will keep an eye out for me. A hour later, I was out of a brand new bike. Do not trust anyone! I learned my lesson the hard way.",

        scam: "My friend and I were taking selfies and a nice older lady asked us did we want to take her to take the picture for us. We gave her the phone and snatched it out her hand and ran away. My phone was not the most expensive phone but now it is gone! Apparently, this is not the first time this couple ran this scam. Ugh!",

        scam: "I was a boy scout when I was younger and I saw some little girls selling girl scout cookies in Central Park. Why not support a good fundraiser? Anyway, I bought two boxes of my favorite cookies, Thin Mints and took the train home (didn't want the chocolate to melt. Well, the good news is the chocolate did not melt. The bad news is there was only half a pack of cookies. Bummer!",

Wicked was super expensive onlineso when I ran into someone selling tickets for them on the corner of Broadway and some other street for nearly half the price I had to buy them. Apparently the story he gave was that he and his girlfriend couldn't go last minute and he didn't want to lose out on any money. The tickets turned out to be bogus. What a wicked person! ",
